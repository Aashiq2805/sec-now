hey,

above is the python file to search for trending repositories through github based on the topic of your preference and post it to twitter

written in python3 it needs two packages to run successfully

these packages are:
1. tweepy
2. PyGithub

to install them :

pip install PyGithub
pip install tweepy

post this we can run the python application to see the output in Lucy's twitter page
